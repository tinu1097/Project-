# Business Objective
Predict temperature based on other attributes available in this data set output variable Motor Temperature(pm) and rest of the coloumns ambient,coolant,u_d,u_q,motor_speed,torque,i_d,i_q,pm,stator_yoke,stator_tooth,stator_einding,profile_id.

## Details of the Feature set:
Ambient temperature as measured by a thermal sensor located closely to the stator,Coolant temperature. The motor is water cooled. Measurement is taken at outflow.u_d-Voltage d-component,u_q-Voltage q-component motor_speed,Motor speed,Torque induced by current,i_d-Current d-component,i_q-Current q-component,pm-Permanent Magnet surface temperature representing the rotor temperature. This was measured with an infrared thermography unit,Stator yoke temperature measured with a thermal sensor,Stator tooth temperature measured with a thermal sensor,Stator winding temperature measured with a thermal sensor,profile_id-Each measurement session has a unique ID. Make sure not to try to estimate from one session onto the other as they are strongly independent.

# Explaination
Measuring the temperature of motor is complex task in real time scenario. The cost of sensor is high and also lifetime of those are less.But also testing every motorâ€™s temperature by placing sensors inside the Stator is not possible.  
By using Machine learning algorithms , the task is made easier. The accuracy by my model is 94.35% and also, I deployed the model using Rshiny  where prediction without dataset is also possible by imputing values in their respective fields
